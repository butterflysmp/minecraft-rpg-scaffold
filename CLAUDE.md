# CLAUDE.md

Read this before writing any code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
mvn clean package        # build all modules
mvn -pl core test        # unit tests (fast, no server)
./scripts/dev-server.sh  # build + deploy + boot a local Paper server
```

Always run `mvn -pl core test` after changing anything in `core/`. Prefer adding
a unit test to `core/` over testing in-game. In-game testing is a 60-second loop;
unit tests are a 2-second loop.

## Environment (verify before assuming)

| Thing | Value |
|---|---|
| Java | **25** (required by Minecraft 26.1+) |
| Paper API | pinned in `pom.xml` as `paper.version` |
| PacketEvents | pinned as `packetevents.version`, `provided` scope, **not shaded** |
| Minecraft versioning | year-based since 26.1 (`26.1`, `26.2`, ...), not `1.21.x` |

## BANNED PATTERNS

Your training data is saturated with Bukkit tutorials from 2015-2023. Most of
what you will reach for first is deprecated or wrong here. Do not write:

| Never write | Write instead |
|---|---|
| `plugin.yml` | `paper-plugin.yml` |
| `onCommand`, `CommandExecutor`, `TabCompleter` | Brigadier via `LifecycleEvents.COMMANDS` |
| `ChatColor`, `§` codes, `ChatColor.translateAlternateColorCodes` | Adventure `Component`, MiniMessage |
| `BukkitRunnable`, `Bukkit.getScheduler().runTask*` | the `Scheduler` interface in `paper/scheduler` |
| NBT reflection, NMS, `CraftPlayer` casts | Persistent Data Containers, `Keys.java` |
| `getServer().getPluginManager().registerEvents` sprawl | one registration point in `RpgPlugin` |
| Hardcoding an ability/weapon/boss in Java | a YAML file in `content/` |

If you believe an exception is warranted, say so and ask. Do not just do it.

## THREADING — the rule that will actually break production

**PacketEvents callbacks run on Netty I/O threads.** They are not the main
thread and not a Folia region thread.

- Inside `onPacketReceive` / `onPacketSend`: read the packet, compute, cancel.
  **Touch nothing else.**
- To reach the Bukkit API from a packet callback, use
  `PacketListenerBase.bukkit(player, () -> ...)`. There is no other sanctioned route.
- Never call `player.sendMessage(...)`, `world.spawnParticle(...)`,
  `entity.setVelocity(...)` or anything else Bukkit from a packet thread.

This bug does not reproduce with one player on a test server. It corrupts state
at forty. Treat a violation as a build-breaking error.

Separately: all scheduling goes through `Scheduler` (`onEntity`, `onRegion`,
`onRegionLater`, `onGlobal`, `async`). This exists so the project runs on Folia
later without a rewrite. `async` must never touch the Bukkit API.

## Architecture invariants

```
core/     pure Java. ZERO dependencies. No Bukkit, no Paper, no PacketEvents, no Gson.
storage/  PlayerRepository port + File impl. Async by contract.
paper/    adapters. The only module that knows Minecraft exists.
```

1. **`core/` must never import `org.bukkit`, `io.papermc`, or
   `com.github.retrooper`.** Its `pom.xml` has no dependencies on purpose. If you
   need a Bukkit type in `core`, you are modelling the wrong thing — define a
   port interface (see `Combatant`, `CombatWorld`) and implement it in `paper/`.

2. **Content is data, not code.** Abilities, weapons, elements' *instances*,
   loot tables, boss phases live in YAML under `content/`. `AbilityLoader` is the
   only class that knows the schema. Adding the 500th weapon must not require a
   recompile.

3. **Never assume one server.** No static mutable singletons holding player
   state. Player data goes through `PlayerRepository`. `Bukkit.getOnlinePlayers()`
   is not the source of truth for "who is playing".

4. **Prefer the Bukkit API over packets.** Every hand-written packet is a thing
   that breaks on protocol changes. Reach for PacketEvents only when the API
   genuinely cannot express the effect (custom UI, damage numbers, telegraphs,
   fake entities).

## Upgrade procedure

Do **not** bump `paper.version` alone. Order of operations:

1. Check PacketEvents supports the new Minecraft drop. It typically lags a
   Minecraft release by 1–2 weeks. It is the gate.
2. Bump `packetevents.version` first, confirm it builds.
3. Bump `paper.version`.
4. Run `mvn -pl core test`. If `core` tests break on a Paper bump, `core` has an
   illegal dependency — that is the real bug.
5. Boot `./scripts/dev-server.sh` and smoke-test one ability end to end.

Never use version ranges. Pin exact builds so the build is reproducible.

## Working with me

- I am rusty at Java. If you use a language feature I may not know — sealed
  interfaces, records, pattern matching in `switch`, `var` — explain it in one
  line rather than assuming.
- Write the `core/` unit test before the `paper/` wiring.
- Keep changes small enough that I can read them.
